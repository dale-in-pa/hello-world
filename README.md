Personal Intro

Hello GitHub,

  My name is Dale and I have been working as tech support at a hospital for about 4 years. My backgrount and formal education is mostly electrical distribution and electronics. I was educated through the Naval Nuclear Power Program and was on the USS Providence out of Groton, CT. I got most of my programming and computer experience while working at Lockheed Martin as a nuclear control systems test tech. I am 49 and hope to retire in about 6 years. I am hoping to use as one of my sources of retirement income a buy here pay here used car lot.
  
  I have been learning and practicing writing code using Python 3 and Tkinter. The project I am working on while learning is basically a CRM for a very small used car dealership. I am fluent and use daily GNU Cash for my personal accuonting and would like to eventually be able to link together a customer and automobile database and traking with GNU Cash. For now I just need to learn the basics of Python and practical GUI input and output creation.
  
  Thanks in advance for the help provided here,
  
  Dale
